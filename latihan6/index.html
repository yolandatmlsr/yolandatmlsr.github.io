            '<h1>Hi My Name is Yolanda Tumilisar!</h1> <h3> I am a Visual Communication Student of Pelita Harapan University anf currently concetrating in Graphic Design. </h3> <h4>I am a person who can lead,  likes to take risks, disciplined, on time, honest and always will be ready to do work fast and responsibly. I love working in teams of new people where I can communicate with people to discuss ideas and brainstorm. A person who is seeking new knowledge, experience and skills. I am an Extroverted person who likes to meet new people and share thoughts or experiences with new people. My hobbies are going out or meeting new people, painting, drawing traditionally and digitally, photography, crafting, anything related to fashion, reading books and talking.</h4> <img src="profile.jpg" height="150">',
            '<h2>My Interest</h2> <h4>If we’re talking about interest, it’s kind of hard for me to sort it out because I tend to get bored easily. But there’s a few things that I am interested in these days. Besides the projects that I love doing in the major that I am taking, which is Graphic Design, I am also very interested in Research and History, especially Art History. I just like how much history really affects an art in many ways, such as in politics, economics, society, etc. History is such an amazing literary or story and from that we can learn and discover so many reasons for the things or the people that exist now. And how incredible some artists and painters can make such concepts in an object, for example Paintings and statues. Since then I have always liked to go to Museums and Art exhibitions to see, learn and mesmerize all of the art works that they exhibited. After graduating from university, I really want to continue my studies in either England, Ireland or Italy to learn more about the history of art and then find a job that relates to that major such as being an Art Curator or art historian in Europe or America. Other than that I really love things that are either using logic or just spontaneous things. Logical things can be reading books, finishing puzzles, sudoku, exploring the things that I am interested in right now like coding, after effects, or just anything that needs more attention and concentration. But there’s also spontaneous things, such as painting, photography, etc. I personally think that art is something that is spontaneous, because ideas can sometimes come anytime and anywhere we are in the world. And it is so funny that usually those ideas can come from objects or a person that we see in our daily lives or just from the feelings that we wanted to express at that time.</h4>',
            '<h2>My Education</h2> <h4>I started my education in Kindergarten where I went to TK Kasih Bunda Jakarta when I was 3 or 4 years old and continued in the same Elementary School until the sixth grade in SDK Kasih Bunda Jakarta. From Elementary School I have started my interest in Art such as painting or music, I tried taking drawing courses and music courses and that became my starting point for liking art. When I reached Junior Highschool my family wanted me to get me out of my comfort zone by putting me in a more educated and disciplined environment. Since then I went from a suburban school in West Jakarta to a Catholic School in the middle of the metropolitan city that is Saint Theresia Jakarta Junior High in Central Jakarta. Studying wasn’t really my thing but I tried my best to get into an even better school of my family dreams in another Catholic School that is Saint Ursula Senior Highschool Jakarta, an all girl school and took a Social Science major. The only subject that I felt connected in Senior High is Art. The teacher in my school really pushed me to use my potential in expressing myself in art media because I am not such an expressible person if we are talking about emotions. She pushed me to be active in the art community in my school, taught me the basics in art and pushed me to take art courses so I can maintain my skills and compete with the other students in school. From that I decided to take my focus fully on art, where I can enjoy and be good in what I like and be more expressible. Because of that I took admission to a lot of art schools, but I picked Pelita Harapan University as my choice and Visual Communication Design as my major with Graphic Design as my concentration. After graduating I hope to continue my studies in a more researchable major such as Art History or Curation Studies of Art in Europe.</h4>'
